## Introduction

This project aims to bring the classic game of 8 ball pool to the blockchain, allowing players to compete in a secure and transparent environment. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, players can verify game actions without revealing sensitive information, ensuring fair gameplay. All the Smart contracts are deployed and verified(on ScrollScan) with the contract addresses as follow:
1. BallPool.sol :  0x74586B4482e94EC89a030cf171886b61aB2cd665.
2. TurnVerifier: 0x332C5Ce79F04a3FC44895eF21A7c6A505416dE13.
3. PocketBallVerifier: 0xeAA57325e6fb04616346B83A355b0560975163E1.
4. StateVerifier: 0x05a7bc653BC228dBAD8dF36Dd206bB42f0a40802.
5. GameOutcomeVerifier: 0xAd5766018731A611628D9dBD5F04a0a4EBac7968.


## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Verify game actions without revealing sensitive information, such as pocketed balls or player turns with noirs ZKPs.
- **Secure Gameplay:** Play 8 ball pool on the blockchain, ensuring the integrity of game actions and outcomes.
- **Transparent Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts govern the game rules, ensuring fairness and transparency for all players.
- **Global Leaderboard:** Compete against players from around the world and climb the global leaderboard.

## How It Works

1. **Game Setup:** Players join a game and set up the game board.
2. **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Players take turns hitting the cue ball and attempting to pocket their assigned balls.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** After each move, players can generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the validity of their actions.
4. **Game Completion:** The game ends when a player pockets all of their balls and the 8 ball, or when a player commits a foul.
5. **Blockchain Verification:** Game outcomes are verified on the blockchain, ensuring fair play and preventing cheating.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 8 Ball Pool On-Chain ZK-Enabled Game, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies for running the game.
2. **Deploy Smart Contracts:** Deploy the smart contracts to your preferred blockchain network.
3. **Play the Game:** Join a game, make your moves, and verify them using zero-knowledge proofs.
4. **Compete and Win:** Compete against other players and climb the global leaderboard!

## Technologies Used
